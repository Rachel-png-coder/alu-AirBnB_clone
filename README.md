# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This is the first step in building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. In this part of the project, we implement the command interpreter (`console.py`). This tool allows us to interact with the backend of our application using text-based commands. It can create, update, delete, and retrieve class instances that will later be stored in JSON format.

The goal is to build the foundation of the backend of the clone by managing data using a custom CLI (command-line interface), and prepare it for integration with a web front-end.

## The Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a command-line interface that allows you to:

- Create new objects
- Retrieve existing objects
- Update object attributes
- Destroy objects
- Save and reload objects from a file (`file.json`)

## How to Start the Console

Start in **interactive mode**:
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
(hbnb) quit
